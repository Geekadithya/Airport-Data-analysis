# Airport-Data-analysis
· Table Au, Python Data Analysis This research uses Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to explore and gain insights from airport data. The goal is to better understand airport operations, identify trends, and fnd ways to improve efciency and make the passenger experience smoother.
# 🛫 Airport Data Analysis using Tableau

This project leverages **Tableau**, a leading data visualization tool, to explore and derive insights from airport operations data. The primary goal is to uncover key trends, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the passenger experience through data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Built an interactive dashboard with filters, slicers, and visuals using **Tableau Public / Tableau Desktop**
- Analyzed airport traffic, passenger flow, wait times, and peak congestion hours
- Identified trends that can support strategic improvements in airport logistics and passenger services
- Integrated **Python** for data cleaning and preprocessing prior to visualization

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies
- Tableau (Data Visualization)
- Python (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- Pandas, NumPy
- CSV/Excel data sources

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard
- 📅 **Time-based Analysis**: Flights, delays, and passenger volume over time
- 📍 **Location-based Views**: Airport-level statistics and heatmaps
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Passenger Metrics**: Age groups, check-in behavior, wait times
- 📈 **Operational KPIs**: On-time performance, cancellations, and turnaround time
